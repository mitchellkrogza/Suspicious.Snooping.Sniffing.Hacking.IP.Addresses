# Suspicious.Snooping.Sniffing.Hacking.IP.Addresses

A daily updated list of suspicious, snooping, sniffing and hacking attempts from IP addresses against services like SSH, HTTP and Wordpress Hack Attempts

This list of IP addresses is produced from REPEAT offenders against various services and ports. 

The list is produced using the [Repeat Offender Blacklist for Fail2Ban](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Fail2Ban-Blacklist-JAIL-for-Repeat-Offenders-with-Perma-Extended-Banning)

It is hence safe to block all these IP addresses from your servers.
